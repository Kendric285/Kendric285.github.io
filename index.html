        <h1>My projects</h1>
        <p>At code next we do many projects</p>
        <p>In the summer we coded on a website called <a href="https://glitch.com/">Glitch</a></p>
        <p>We did projects such as making a watermelon, making an emoji, animating our emoji </p>
        <p>The video and images below are the projects on glitch</p>
        <video controls="controls" width="400" height="400" 
        name="Video Name" src="Animation_kt.mov"></video>
        <img src="wasa.png" width="400" height="400">
        <img src="dbz.png" width="400 " height="400">
        <p> My favorite project was the one in the video because of how it came out, and the time it took to do it</p>
        <p>At the beginning of Team Edge we were learning the basics of javascript.</p>
        <p>We didn't do many projects but we had to write code to solve problems</p>
        <p>For example, we did a haunted house project in which we had to code a game that was all based off the user's decsicions </p>
